For Single Women in China, Owning a Home Is a New Form of Resistance

 

单身购房，中国女性追求性别平等的新方式

 

After she signed the contract for her new apartment in southern China, Guo Miaomiao, 32, ran through the mental list of what she would get to enjoy as a homeowner. A leather couch in the living room. A pumpkin pendant lamp that she’d been eyeing online.

 

32岁的郭淼淼（音）在中国南方买了新房，签完合同后，她在脑海中过了一遍作为房主将享受到的一切。客厅里有一张真皮沙发，天花板上挂着她在网上看中很久的南瓜色吊灯。

 

And, most important, a way to defy expectations in China about the role that a woman should play in a marriage.

 

而最重要的是，她以这种方式打破了中国人对女性在婚姻中所扮演角色的期望。

 

“I’ve seen too many cases, including among my relatives and friends, where the husband buys the house, and the minute the couple argues, the husband tells her to get out,” said Ms. Guo, who works at a technology company in the city of Guangzhou. “This gives me confidence that if I do get married, I won’t be afraid of anything. Even if I leave him, I can live independently.”

 

“我见过太多这样的例子，包括亲戚朋友之间，丈夫买了房子，只要夫妻一吵架，丈夫就让她滚出去，”在广州一家科技公司工作的郭淼淼说。“买房让我相信，就算我结婚了也什么都不怕。就算离开他，我也能独立生活。”

 

Ms. Guo is one of a growing number of unmarried Chinese women buying property — a trend that strikes at one of Chinese society’s most deeply rooted gender norms. For centuries, men, no matter their income level, have been expected to own a home to be eligible for marriage. For married women, in turn, the home of their husband effectively becomes their only one, as they are no longer considered part of their birth families, or as a Chinese saying puts it: “A married daughter is like water splashed away.”

 

郭淼淼属于越来越多未婚买房的中国女性群体——这一趋势冲击了中国社会最根深蒂固的性别规范。几个世纪以来，无论收入水平如何，男性要有房才有资格结婚。对于已婚女性来说，丈夫的家实际上成了她们唯一的家，因为她们不再被视为原生家庭的一部分，正如中国的一句俗话：“嫁出去的女儿泼出去的水”。
