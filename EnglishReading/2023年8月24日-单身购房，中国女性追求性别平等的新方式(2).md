Now, more Chinese women are demanding homes of their own.

 

现在，越来越多的中国女性想要拥有自己的房子。

 

A recent survey by China Youth Daily, a state-run newspaper, found that nearly 94 percent of respondents approved of single women buying property, with two-thirds saying it signaled a desire for gender equality. While official statistics on the actual rate of homeownership are limited, one government survey in 2020 found that the percentage of unmarried women who owned property had risen to 10.3 percent from 6.9 percent a decade earlier. And the numerical bump was even greater, as the number of single women aged 25 and older had grown by nearly 10 million during the same period.

 

官方报纸《中国青年报》最近的一项调查发现，近94%的受访者赞成单身女性购买房产，三分之二的人表示这表明了对性别平等的渴望。尽管有关实际住房拥有率的官方统计数据有限，但2020年的一项政府调查发现，未婚女性拥有房产的比例已从十年前的6.9%上升至10.3%，而由于25岁及以上的单身女性人数同期增加了近1000万，实际数字更高。

 

The increase in female buyers is coinciding with intense turmoil in China’s housing sector. Many big and small developers have run out of money and left apartments unfinished, driving away prospective customers. Buyers like Ms. Guo saw an opportunity: She took advantage of the drop in housing prices and mortgage rates to buy a finished, and partly furnished, two-bedroom unit.

 

女性购房者增多，恰逢中国房市遭遇剧烈动荡。许多大大小小的开发商资金耗尽，公寓无法完工，失去了潜在客户。像郭淼淼这样的买家看到了机会：她利用房价和贷款利率下降的机会，购买了一套包含部分家具的两居室现房。

 

On Chinese social media, property agents have begun targeting single women, posting promotional videos with hashtags like “a little house suitable for single ladies.”

 

在中国的社交媒体上，房地产经纪人已经开始将单身女性作为目标客户，发布的视频带有“适合单身女士的小房子”等标签。

 

“It’s an awakening toward the rights of women,” said Wang Mengqi, an assistant professor of anthropology at Duke Kunshan University in Suzhou who has studied the property purchasing patterns of young Chinese. The shift is part of growing attention to women’s rights more generally. Though the Chinese government, as part of its larger crackdown on civil society, has tried to suppress feminist activists and organizations, topics such as the #MeToo movement and the lack of domestic violence protections have frequently topped social media discussions in recent years. Concerns about a slowing economy and an emerging preference for an independent lifestyle have also led many young Chinese to reject marriage altogether, with the number of marriage registrations in 2022 dropping to a record low of 6.8 million.

 

“这是对女性权利的觉醒，”苏州昆山杜克大学人类学助理教授王梦琪说，她研究中国年轻人的购房模式。这一转变是人们对女性权利普遍关注的一部分。在中国政府对公民社会的镇压中，对女权活动人士和女权组织的压制是其中的一部分，但#MeToo运动、缺乏家暴保护等话题近年来不时成为社交媒体讨论的焦点。对经济放缓感到担忧、独立生活方式日益受到欢迎等因素也导致许多中国年轻人干脆不结婚，2022年结婚登记人数为680万，降至历史新低。
