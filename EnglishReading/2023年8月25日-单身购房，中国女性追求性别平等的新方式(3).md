Ms. Guo, the home buyer in Guangzhou, developed an insecurity around housing from an early age. Growing up in a big family with eight siblings in a conservative area of Guangdong Province, it became clear, from things her relatives and friends said, that once married, she wouldn’t be able to live in her parents’ home anymore.

 

广州购房者郭淼淼在住房问题上的不安全感从小就有。她在广东一个传统地区长大，家里有八个兄弟姐妹，她可以从亲戚朋友的话中听出来，一旦结婚，她就不能再住在父母家里了。

 

Ms. Guo, who described herself as naturally rebellious, resolved early on to buy herself a home. After graduating from college, she worked in several big cities across China, chasing increasingly ambitious job opportunities. In the last five years, she saved $70,000. And in March, she turned her dream into reality.

 

自称天生叛逆的郭淼淼很早就决定给自己买一套房子。大学毕业后，她在中国的几个大城市工作过，寻求越来越有前途的工作职位。过去五年里，她存了约50万元。今年3月，她将梦想变成了现实。

 

“I want to prove to everyone that women are not limited to the only option of marriage. I could have many other choices,” Ms. Guo said.

 

“我想向所有人证明，女性并不只有婚姻这一个选项。我可以有很多其他选择，”郭淼淼说。

 

Alongside changing attitudes, practical changes such as rising incomes have also helped increase the rate of single female homeownership. In 2021, the number of Chinese women receiving college education overtook the number of men, according to official statistics. And the number of female workers in urban areas is up by nearly 40 percent compared with a decade ago.

 

除了观念的改变，收入增加等现实变化也有助于提高单身女性的住房拥有率。据官方统计，2021年，中国接受大学教育的女性人数超过男性。与10年前相比，城市女性劳动力数量增加了近40%。

 

Legal developments have also made wives more aware of the financial risks of living in homes their husbands own. Until 2011, divorce courts treated family homes as joint property. But as both property prices and divorce rates soared, China’s supreme court ruled that property acquired before marriage belonged only to the person who had either made the down payment or bought the property outright — leaving many divorced women essentially homeless, even if they had contributed to mortgage payments.

 

法律的变动也使妻子们更加意识到，住在丈夫名下的房产存在财务风险。2011年之前，离婚法庭将家庭住宅视为共同财产。但随着房价和离婚率飙升，中国最高法院裁定，婚前获得的财产只属于付首付或全款买房的一方——这使得许多离婚女性没有房产，即使贡献了住房贷款。

 

That change helped Zhang Ye, a 27-year-old accountant in the western city of Xi’an, persuade her parents to help her buy an apartment. She would have to help a future husband make mortgage payments anyway, she argued, so her own property would be a savvier — and safer — financial investment.

 

法律上的变化让住在西安的27岁会计师张野（音）说服父母帮助她买一套房。她认为，无论如何，她都不得不帮未来的丈夫支付贷款，所以她自己拥有的财产将是一个更明智、更安全的财务投资。
