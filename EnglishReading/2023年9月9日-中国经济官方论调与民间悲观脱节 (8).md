The government’s blame of external forces for the slowdown does have supporters. Wang Ainian, a barber in Chedun, pointed to news reports about the trade war with the United States and Japanese restrictions on the export of computing chips, when asked why business had slowed at local factories.

政府将经济放缓归咎于外部因素的说法确实有支持者。当被问及当地工厂的业务为何放缓时，车墩镇的理发师王爱年（音）提到了有关中美贸易战和日本限制计算机芯片出口的新闻报道。

The economic pain has also been spread unevenly across the country. The wealthy, more insulated from uncertainties, continue to spend on luxury goods. Many malls and train stations are bustling again, though most shoppers and travelers are spending less and choosing cheaper destinations. Among some lower-income Chinese, familiarity with hardship has also blunted the pessimism of the recent downturn.

经济痛苦在全国的分布也不均匀。富裕阶层不受不确定因素的影响，继续购买奢侈品。许多购物中心和火车站重新热闹起来，尽管大多数购物者和旅行者减少了支出，并选择了更便宜的目的地。在一些收入较低的中国人中，对困难的熟悉也削弱了对近期经济低迷的悲观情绪。

But even for Mr. Wang, no matter who is responsible for the economic pain, he had little hope that it would reverse itself soon. He was seeing only about two-thirds of the customers that he had the year before, and half of prepandemic levels. And that was in a world-class city like Shanghai, not his hometown in inland Anhui Province.

但即使是对王爱年来说，无论谁应该为经济痛苦负责，他也并不指望这种情况会很快逆转。他接待的客户只有去年的三分之二左右，是大流行前的一半。而且是在上海这样的世界级城市，不是他在内陆省份安徽的家乡。

Despite urging consumers to spend more, the government has rejected the idea of cash handouts to households, calling it too costly. It has brandished tax incentives for purchases of new homes, even as it has continued to erode the already weak social safety net that makes many Chinese leery of big purchases.

尽管政府敦促消费者增加支出，但拒绝向家庭发放现金的想法，称其成本太高。政府为购买新房提供税收优惠，同时继续削弱本已薄弱的社会保障体系，使许多中国人对大额消费持怀疑态度。

On Monday, the Ministry of Finance halved the tax on stock transactions, in an attempt to boost investor confidence. But that would not remedy how unwilling people are to buy stocks in the first place, given a lack of faith that they would grow in value, said Professor Chen: “When the future is so uncertain, then it does not matter what kind of transaction costs you charge.”

周一，财政部将股票交易税减半，试图提振投资者信心。但这并不能改变人们从一开始就不愿意购买股票的想法，因为他们对股票增值缺乏信心，陈志武说：“当未来这么不确定，收取什么样的交易成本都无所谓。”

“Detachment” between the top leadership and the reality of many Chinese, he added, “is clearly there.”

他还说，高层领导和许多中国人的现实之间的“脱节”是“显而易见”的。
