When their government abruptly ended its harsh Covid measures in December, many Chinese expected a robust rebound from pent-up demand. Eight months later, China is instead facing an accumulation of bad news: record youth unemployment, a deep housing slump, stagnant spending, even deflation.

中国政府去年12月突然结束了遏制新冠病毒的严厉措施后，许多中国人曾预料，被压抑的需求将给经济反弹带来强劲动力。然而，八个月后，中国却面临着越来越多的坏消息：年轻人失业率创下纪录，房地产市场严重衰退，老百姓不消费，甚至可能出现经济通货紧缩。

That’s a shock to many Chinese who are used to an economy that kept on expanding and living standards that rose with it. Now they’re contending with slowing businesses and shrinking personal fortunes.

这让许多习惯了经济持续增长、生活水平不断提高的中国人感到震惊。他们现在不得不应对生意不好做、个人财富缩减的问题。

I talked to over a dozen business owners and consumers, as I have been doing for years, and I can report: Their confidence in the future of the economy and the country is at a nadir. If they had hoped for a rebound, that hope has been extinguished. They worry that it’s the beginning of something they don’t dare to imagine and fear that the government doesn’t have solutions. The bad news just keeps coming.

我像往常一样采访了十多位企业主和消费者，我可以把他们告诉我的总结为：他们对经济和国家未来的信心正处于最低点。如果说他们曾对经济反弹抱有希望的话，这种希望已经破灭。他们担心这是他们不敢想象的情况的开端，并担心政府没有解决方案。坏消息不断传来。

“The most terrifying thing is that everyone around me is at a loss of what to do next,” said Richard Li, the owner of an auto parts wholesale business. “I used to believe that our country would become better and better.”

“最可怕的就是大家都很迷茫，都不知道下步怎么办，”一家汽车配件批发公司的老板理查德·李（音）说。“我曾经觉得这个国家会慢慢变好。”

In the first half of 2023, the revenue of Mr. Li’s business fell 15 percent from a year ago, when the city he lives in — with more than 10 million other people — was locked down for weeks.

在2023年上半年，李先生的生意收入比去年同期减少了15%，他居住的人口超过1000万的城市曾在去年上半年被封控了好几周。

He discovered that other companies like his were struggling, too. Some of his clients, auto repair shops, even shut their doors because car owners were reducing spending.

他发现，其他像他这样的企业也在苦苦挣扎。他的一些客户是汽车修理店，因为车主减少开支，有些修理店甚至已经关门。

Mr. Li had four stores and closed two of them. He let go two-thirds of his employees and stopped investing in new products. He also cut back on dining out and hanging out with his buddies. Strapped for cash, he tried to sell an apartment he bought in 2020 as an investment. But there have been few queries, even after he cut the price to $400,000 from $500,000.

李先生曾有四家店，其中两家已关张。他解雇了三分之二的员工，也不再投资新产品。他还减少了下馆子和与朋友聚会的次数。由于现金短缺，他曾试图出售自己在2020年买的一套用于投资的公寓。但即使在他将售价从330万元降到290万元后，也几乎无人问津。

It’s getting harder for people like Mr. Li to rely on the Chinese government to know what’s going on in the economy. Data it has released for years has been held back. Last week, it stopped sharing the unemployment rate for young people after the data hit a high at 21.3 percent in June.

对李先生这样的人来说，依靠中国政府来了解经济状况已变得越来越难。政府已停止发布一些多年来一直定期发布的数据。6月份的年轻人失业率达到了前所未有的21.3%后，政府上周暂停了发布这个数据。

But a set of official data the government was willing to share about July was bad enough.

但政府已发布的一组7月份的官方数据足够糟糕。

Consumer prices in China fell last month for the first time in more than two years. Chinese banks extended $47.5 billion of new renminbi loans, tumbling 89 percent from June — and half the amount of a year earlier. Housing sales in terms of footage fell 6.5 percent in the first seven months of the year, after shrinking by nearly a quarter last year. In a country where three-fifths of the household assets are tied up in real estate, that decline is alarming.

上个月，中国消费者价格出现了两年多来的首次下降。中国各银行的人民币贷款增加了3459亿元，与6月份相比减少了89%，只是去年同期的一半。今年前七个月的商品房销售面积与去年同期相比下降了6.5%，而去年的商品房销售面积已经萎缩了近25%。在这个60%的家庭资产与房地产捆绑在一起的国家，这种下降令人震惊。

The anxiety is running so high that people are using a social media site called Xiaohongshu to post talismans they think could help them sell houses.

人们的焦虑如此之高，甚至有人开始在名为“小红书”的社交媒体上传驱邪物，他们认为这样做能帮助他们把房子卖出去。

China slipped into deflation after the government’s draconian “zero Covid” policy drastically suppressed consumption and business activity last year. Chenggang Xu, an economist at Stanford University, explained why deflation can be pernicious.

去年，政府严厉的“新冠清零”政策严重抑制了消费和商业活动，中国曾陷入通货紧缩。斯坦福大学经济学家许成钢解释了为什么通货紧缩可能有害经济。

“The best scenario is that everyone expects prices will keep decreasing, so they will keep waiting for the prices to fall further,” he said. “The worst scenario is that people are very scared and very anxious.” Fear about their jobs or the survival of their businesses, he said, will cause them to save more and spend less, pushing the economy further into the trap of deflation.

“往最好的地方说，所有人都是看跌。在看跌的情况下，一定就是等着跌得更低，”他说。“往更不好的地方讲，就是人们其实很害怕，很担心。”他表示，担心丢掉工作或担心企业经营不下去将导致人们增加储蓄、减少支出，从而将经济进一步推入通货紧缩的陷阱。

With anxiety running high, people are already saving more and spending less.

由于焦虑情绪高涨，人们已开始多存钱、少花钱。

Cob Liu, founder of an education start-up in a big city in southwestern China, said his revenue has remained flat this year, which is bad for a company that used to grow 40 percent a year. Mr. Liu, in his mid-30s, has about $1.5 million in cash but is determined to keep his monthly spending around $800, half of which goes to rent. He will keep his five-year-old Toyota Corolla and not buy property anytime soon. He bought apartments in two complexes in 2019 and the developers of both stopped building after running out of money. That is a nightmare that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Chinese have been going through since the housing boom came to a sudden end.

考博·刘（音）在中国西南部一座大城市创办了一家教育初创公司，他说，他今年的营收持平，这对一家以前每年增长40%的公司来说是个坏消息。刘先生30多岁，虽然手中有约1000万的现金，但他已决心将每月的支出控制在五六千元，其中一半是房租。他的车（一辆丰田卡罗拉）是五年前买的，他不打算换新车，短期内也不打算买房。他曾在2019年买了两个楼盘的公寓，但这两个楼盘的开发商都已在资金耗尽后停工。这是中国的房地产繁荣突然结束后，数十万甚至数百万中国人正在经历的噩梦。

Mr. Liu believes that the decline in the Chinese economy could drag on for years. He sold all his positions in mainland China stocks earlier this year and said he would not touch shares of any Chinese companies, even if they’re traded in New York or Hong Kong.

刘先生认为，中国经济可能会连续几年下滑。他已在今年早些时候卖掉了手里所有中国大陆企业的股票，并表示他不会碰任何中国公司的股票，即使它们在纽约或香港的交易所上市。

Boris Dai, 44, is a commercial real estate consultant in Beijing who earned less than $15,000 in the first six months of this year. That is half what he made during the pandemic and less than 15 percent of his previous earnings. His other source of income — an office space he rents out — evaporated after his tenant went out of business six months ago.

现年44岁的鲍里斯·戴（音）是北京的一名商业房地产顾问，他今年前六个月的收入不到10万元，只有他疫情期间收入的一半，还不到疫情前的15%。他的另一个收入来源是出租办公空间，租户已在六个月前倒闭，让他的这笔收入落空。

“I can only lie flat,” Mr. Dai said, using a phrase that describes taking a break from relentless work. “I have no expectations for the future.” He converted his sport utility vehicle into a sleeper vehicle so he and his wife could save on hotels when they travel.

“我现在的心态就是躺平，”戴先生说。“对未来没什么期待。”他已将自己的运动型多功能车改装成了房车，这样他和妻子外出旅行时就可以把酒店钱省下来。

Even entrepreneurs who are doing well are reluctant to take out loans because of their uncertain prospects.

即使是经营状况良好的企业家也因为前景不确定而不愿贷款。

Mark Fu, founder of a financial advisory firm with offices in Chengdu and Hong Kong, said his business has been booming this year. Many wealthy Chinese, he explained, realized during the pandemic that money couldn’t buy them safety or dignity and have sought his help to move their financial assets outside China. Banks offered him business loans at low interest rates, but he’s reluctant to take on debt. Instead of expanding, he has reduced his staff to 10 employees from 12 through attrition.

马克·傅（音）是一家金融咨询公司的创始人，这家公司在成都和香港设有办事处。他说，他今年的业务量激增。他解释说，原因是许多富有的中国人在疫情期间意识到，再有钱也买不来安全或尊严，所以他们向他寻求帮助，将金融资产转移到境外。银行可以提供低利率的商业贷款，但他不愿意借债。他没有扩大公司，而是让员工从12人自然减少到10人。

He said he was horrified by the government’s clampdowns on one industry after another during the pandemic. He said he used to believe that if he worked hard, he would succeed. Now he fears that how he runs his business isn’t what matters most.

他说，他对政府在疫情期间打击了一个又一个行业感到大为震惊。他说，他曾相信只要努力工作，一定会成功。现在他担心，自己如何经营并不是最要紧的事。

“Is the government going to wipe you all out in one go?” he asked, “or let you make some money?” He also has an apartment he’s been unable to sell.

“国家是要把你一锅端了？”他问道：“还是说让你可以赚点钱？”他也有一套一直卖不出去的公寓。

The mood on social media has become so bleak that a commentary in Securities Daily, an official publication, called for the suppression of posts that speculate about troubles ahead. Rumormongering had set off market fluctuations, the article said, quoting headlines such as “China’s version of Lehman Brothers is coming!” and “A brokerage firm to hold a conference call of ‘the darkest hour.’”

社交媒体上的情绪已变得如此之黯淡，以至于官方出版物《证券日报》上的一篇评论呼吁，严格审查那些推测未来麻烦的帖子。文章称，那些以“某信托爆雷了”、“中国版雷曼要来了！”、“某券商要召开‘至暗时刻’的电话会议”为标题的造谣帖子已引发了市场波动。

People despair because they can’t picture how China can get out of its downward spiral. The root of the troubles, they believe, is the ideology of Xi Jinping, China’s paramount leader, who seems to dislike the private sector and has dismantled elements of the market economy that made China an economic success.

人们因无法想象中国将如何摆脱恶性循环而感到绝望。他们认为，问题的根源是中国最高领导人习近平的意识形态。习近平似乎不喜欢民营企业，并已逐步废除了曾让中国取得经济成功的一些市场经济要素。

At 35, Andy Wang quit his job at a bank earlier this year to prepare to apply for graduate school in Australia. He was put off last fall when a slate of new party leaders was announced, all protégés of Mr. Xi. “The corrective ability of this country was lost after that,” he said.

现年35岁的安迪·王（音）已在今年早些时候辞去了他在银行的工作，准备申请去澳大利亚读研究生。去年秋天，中共召开“二十大”后公布了一批新领导人的名单，这份名单令他反感，新领导人全是习近平的亲信。“这个国家最后纠错的能力已经丧失了，”他说。

His parents are wealthy, but he’s pessimistic he will have the same opportunities they once enjoyed. “I can’t see any way to make money in this country,” he said. “I’m not even sure if I can maintain my current living standard. I could only strive for survival.”

虽然他的父母很有钱，但他对自己是否能有他们曾经有过的同样机会感到悲观。“国内是不可能挣到钱的，”他说。“现在想办法不说保证现在的生活，（只）能保证一个基本的生活能力。”
