Concerns about the economy, propaganda outlets have insisted, have been inflated by Western politicians and media outlets engaged in “cognitive warfare.” One social media account backed by China’s state broadcaster released a video that purported to investigate how foreign news outlets had cherry-picked statistics that predicted higher economic growth, just so they could later say China fell short. “At the end of the day, they are fated to be slapped in the face by reality,” a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry said this month about the purported Western naysayers.

官方媒体喉舌坚称，是掀起“认知争夺战”的西方政客和媒体夸大了中国经济的问题。中国国家电视台支持的一个社交媒体帐号发布了一段视频，揭露外国媒体如何故意筛选预测中国经济更高增长的数据，以便之后唱衰中国。“（他们）最终难逃被现实打脸的命运，”中国外交部发言人本月在谈到所谓的西方唱反调者时表示。

When the reality has proved too inconvenient, another approach has simply been to conceal it, as when Beijing this month stopped publishing the youth unemployment rate, which had been at a record high. The decision was widely mocked by Chinese social media users, who joked that the government had finally landed on an effective fix.

当现实被证明不太美好的时候，另一个办法就是掩盖它，就像北京本月停止公布青年失业率一样，该数据曾创历史新高。这一决定遭到了中国社交媒体用户的广泛嘲讽，他们调侃称，政府终于找到了解决失业的妙招。
